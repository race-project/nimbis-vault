# Packer instructions

Need to set the following environment variables before building with Packer:

- packer_aws_region
- packer_os_version
- packer_build_author

Example:
			
	export packer_aws_region="us-east-2"
	export packer_os_version="7.8"
	export packer_build_author="John Doe"

TO DO: Add some (more) packer build instructions.
